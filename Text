Tao, Not Tao

The Way that can be described is not the eternal Way.
The name that can be spoken is not the eternal name.
This namelessness is the boundary between our world and the mystery
Naming is the birth of creation

But the mnystery and your reality emerge from the same source.
The source is beyond light.
Darkness born in darkness.
The root of all that can be known.

Before our universe was born, there was the one thing.
It is alone and empty, solitary, and unchanging.
It is ever present and eternal.
It is like the motehr of the universe.
It has no name, but we call it the Way.

It is everywhere.
Because it is everywhere, it is eternal.
Being eternal means that all things return to it.

Way. Heaven. Life.

Within our universe, these are the three great things.

Life follows Heaven.
Heaven follows the Way.
The Way follows itself.
